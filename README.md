I built this Weather App as the final project of my SheCodes Plus coding course. 

Features: 
- It shows the current temperature as well as 5 days forcast.
- Location can be searched for in a searchbox or the current location can be chosen by using the pin button.
- The picture in the background changes depending on the weather.
- The page is responsive and mostly accessable. 
- API from OpenWeather is used to provida weather data.

Improvements plan:
- use date format from a library to replace date format written in JS
- change the input placeholder using bootstrap so that it doesn't disappear
